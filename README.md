# Test task

### Layout:
#### Main tasks:
1. The layout should be done using pure html/css/js without using third-party libraries or frameworks;
2. The layout should be adaptive and correctly displayed in current versions of Google Chrome and Firefox;
3. The layout must be valid (https://validator.w3.org /);
4. Using semantic tags;
5. BEM;
6. Validation of the form in the modal window, required fields are marked with an asterisk (checking fields only for emptiness);
7. Implement all states on components from the ui kit, except for bootable ones.

#### Additional tasks:
1. Implementation of the rubber layout;
2. Using modern font formats (woff2, woff);
3. Using the picture tag to support webp and retina displays;
4. Adding a mask to the phone input field (city/operator code and Russian flag only [+7]).
5. The phone number field is additionally validated for the area/operator code and length.
6. A block with an agreement on the use of cookies appears at the bottom of the screen and simply closes when interacting with it, without saving data.
7. (Block with iPhone) Make a cyclic animation (passing left-to-right /right-to-left/left-to-right) of the inscriptions "How Budss Works".

### Javascript:
You need to make a slider in pure js (without jquery).
Slider example: Single item slider from here - http://kenwheeler .github.io/slick/.

#### Requirements:
1. The slider must work on any number of images from 1 to 10;
2. When clicking on the right control (arrow) of the slider, when the slider reaches the last image, the first image should also go out on the right. Wrong option: the slider scrolls to the left to the first image;
3. Do animations in javascript and don't use css transitions. setInterval (http://javascript.ru/setinterval ) - a function that will be needed to make an animation;
4. If you click on the slider many times during the animation, the slides should not switch until the animation is over. For example: If I click 20 times on the slider control (arrow) during animation, nothing happens. When the animation ended and I clicked 21 times, the slide switched to the next one;
5. When I click on the point at the bottom of the slider, I have to go to the corresponding slide. If the current slide is the one I clicked on, nothing should happen.;
6. The point of the current slide should stand out somehow;
7. Dragging slides with the mouse (as in the example) is not necessary;
8. Keyboard control (as in the example) is not necessary;
9. Should work correctly in the latest version of Firefox and Chrome.
